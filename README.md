## Pull Request Acceptance Prediction

This repo documents how my project team developed pull request acceptance prediction models using machine learning algorithms

## Introduction

Pull requests are an important tool for distributed software development.  When developers contribute to a source code repository that uses a distributed version control system (like Github), they can initiate a pull request to ask the project maintainers to "pull" the changes into production code [1].
