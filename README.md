## Pull Request Acceptance Prediction

This repo documents how my project team developed pull request acceptance prediction models using machine learning algorithms.

## Introduction

Pull requests are an important tool for distributed software development.  When developers contribute to a source code repository that uses a distributed version control system (like Github), they can initiate a pull request to ask the project maintainers to "pull" the changes into production code [1]. Project maintainers may then review the proposed source code changes and accept or reject the associated pull request.  If a pull request is accepted, the proposed changes are added to the production code.  Otherwise, the production code remains unchanged.
